# MyScheduleBuilderv1.0
(Java Desktop Application I made in 2018) PURPOSE: to organise the daily activities in the shortest time possible. Sadly, I didn't keep improving certain aspects of the program, and I can't modify the Netbeans project anymore. It is still really useful for me, so I could create from scratch a version v2.0 to add a Database with frequent activities, better design, higher quantity of items to add, possibility to go back between the last steps. Next time also I could share all the files, the project files got lost in my last computer, but I hope you could still enjoy my work.
